The purpose of comments:-

Html comments has some various purpose:

Comments are useful for documentation, Debugging, Reminder, and work in progress. 

Documentation is useful for me and others because anyone uses comments in code, It means the developers basically describe the purpose and functionality of certain code.

Debugging is also feel easy when proper comments are written in the entire code.

Comments are also very useful for reminding of future prospects and modifications or improvements in the code.

Comments can also mark certain unfinished sections or indicate that certain code is under development.

Comments are some text or code written in your code to give an explanation about the code, and not visible to the user. Comments which are used for HTML file are known as HTML comments. Anything written between these tags will be ignored by the browser, so comments will not be visible or rendering on the webpage.
basically we can write comments for our future self and for the other developers who might work on the same codebase.
so we can create a comments in code which will not rendering on the browser screen.
