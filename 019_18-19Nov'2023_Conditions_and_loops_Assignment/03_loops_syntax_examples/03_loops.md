## loops
## for
...
The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations beforehand
...
## syntax
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## while
...
The while loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues until a certain condition is false.
...
## syntax
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## do-while
...
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code inside the loop will be executed at least once, as the condition is checked after the loop body.
...
## syntax
```javascript
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
