Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is an important aspect of writing clean, maintainable, and readable code. Descriptive names make it easier for you and your colleagues to understand the purpose of a piece of code, which in turn saves time and reduces the chances of introducing bugs.

Some way for Choosing meaningful variable names:

(1) Use names that are descriptive of the variable's purpose. For example, a variable that stores the number of items in a cart should be named num_items instead of i.

(2) Use consistent naming conventions. For example, if you are using Python, you should use snake_case for variable names.

(3) Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are well-known. If you do use an abbreviation or acronym, be sure to document it.

(4) Keep your variable names short and to the point. Avoid using long, descriptive names that are difficult to read.

(5) Use proper nouns for constants. For example, the constant for the speed of light should be named SPEED_OF_LIGHT.

example:if I declare for the name of ID of student....

let studentID;
