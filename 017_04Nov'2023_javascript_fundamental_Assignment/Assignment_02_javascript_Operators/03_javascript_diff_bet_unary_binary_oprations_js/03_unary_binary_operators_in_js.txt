Difference between Unary and binary operators in Javascript:-

In programming, operators are symbols that represent computations. They can be used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and control the flow of a program. There are two main categories of operators: unary and binary.
Unary operators operate on a single operand, while binary operators operate on two operands. Here are some examples of unary and binary operators in JavaScript.

Unary operators:

typeof - returns the type of a variable
delete - deletes a property from an object
! - logical NOT
- - negation
+ - positive sign
~ - bitwise NOT

Binary operators:

+ - addition
- - subtraction
* - multiplication
/ - division
% - modulus
== - equality
=== - Strict equality
!= - inequality
< - less than
> - greater than
<= - less than or equal to
>= - greater than or equal to
&& - logical AND
|| - logical OR
^ - bitwise XOR
& - bitwise AND
| - bitwise OR
<< - left shift
>> - right shift
