// Operators in javascript are categrized in four groups based on their functionality:-

// 1.Arithematic Operators:
//--------------------------

// Addition (+)
let add = 2+ 5; // the add variable has 7 value .



//subraction (-)
let sub = 5-2; // the sub variable has 3 value



//Multiplication (*)
let multi = 6*4; // the multi variable has 24 value.


//Division (/)
let div = 20/4 ;  // the div variable has 5 value.


//expontiation (**)
let power = 3**2; //the power variable has 8 value.


// Modulo (%)
let rem = 11/2; // the rem variable has 1 value.this is called reminder value.


// 2. assignment Operators:
//-------------------------

// Assignment Operator (=)
let newVar = 15; // 15 is to assign to newVar variable.


//Addition assignment uorator (+=)
newVar += 5; // newVar is now 20.


//Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
newVar -=5; // newVar is now 15.


//Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
newVar *=2; // newVar is now 30.


//Division assignment operator (/=)
newVar /=2; // newVar is now 15.


//Modulo assignment operator (%=)
newVar %=3; // newVar is now 0.


//Comparision Operator:
//---------------------

//Equal to (==)
let Equal = 10 == 10; // Eual isnow true.



//Not Equal to (!=)
let notEqual =10 != 10; // notEqual is now false.


//Greater than (>)
let greaterThan = 10 < 5; // greaterThan is now True.


//Less than (<)
let lessThan = 10 < 5; // lessThan is now false.


//Greater then or equal to (>=)
const greaterThanOrEqual = 10 >= 10; // greaterThanOrEqual is now  true.


//Less then or equal to (<=)
const lessThanOrEqual = 10 <= 5; // lessThanOrEqaul is  now  false.


//Logical Operator:
//-----------------

// AND (&&)
const AndTrue = true && true; // AndTrue is now true.


//OR (||)
const OrTrue = true || false; // OrTrue is now true.


//NOT (!)
const NotTrue = !true; // NotTrue is now t false.


const NotFalse = !false; //  NotFalse is now true.
