HTML Accessibility

(1) Semantic HTML:

Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the <button> element (and not a <div> element).

semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

exapmle: <button> Hello </button>

(2)Heading :

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections.

Screen readers also use headings as a navigational tool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags:

exapmle:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

(3)Alternative Text:

The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

exapmle:
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="A narrow city street with flowers in Chania">

If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute:

(4)Declare the Language:

You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

example :

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>

...

</body>
</html>
