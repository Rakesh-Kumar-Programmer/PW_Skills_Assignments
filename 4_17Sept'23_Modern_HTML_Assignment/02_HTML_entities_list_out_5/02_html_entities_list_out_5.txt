HTML Entities:

An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). HTML entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use HTML character entities in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
