    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    <p>
      Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many
      people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people
      with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also
      benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with
      slow network connections.
